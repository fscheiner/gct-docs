=== Programming Model Overview ===

Globus XIO is based on an event based asynchronous programming model.
This model is described in great detail at:
link:#globus-async[Asynchronous Event Handling]. In short, with Globus
XIO, connections are opened and closed. While open, read and write
requests are posted with a callback function pointer given by the user.
When the event completes, the given callback is called. 


=== Component API ===

You can find documentation of the XIO library at:

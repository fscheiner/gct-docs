No additional configuration is required to use MyProxy clients after
they are installed, although you may want to set the MYPROXY_SERVER
environment variable to the hostname of your myproxy-server in the
default user environment on your systems.

Please refer to the http://grid.ncsa.illinois.edu/myproxy/adminguide.html[MyProxy
Admin Guide] for MyProxy server configuration instructions.
